# AdaStride
* Official PyTorch implementation of the paper "AdaStride: Using Adaptive Strides in Sequential Data for Effective Downsampling"
* It provides the source code implementing the AdaStride with the test code for the speech emotion recognition experiments using the IEMOCAP dataset

## Prepare and preprocess the IEMOCAP dataset
* Ensure you have the IEMOCAP dataset and preprocess the dataset using `prepare_dataset.ipynb` file.
